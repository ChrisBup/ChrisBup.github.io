    <p>I'm a recent gradutate of the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly, a 12-week full-time dev bootcamp and I'm excited to hone my new skills as a junior developer. What really inspired me to take that on was my previous position at <a href='http://www.sketchbookproject.com/'>The Sketchbook Project</a>, a start-up that runs global, crowdsourced, interactive art projects. That's where I learned how technology can promote real interaction and engagement.</p>
    <p>I think both development and design come down to organizing data so that it's most accessible to the user. So for me, it's all about conveying a message or presenting information as efficiently as possible.</p>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I like to listen to podcasts on long runs, play pick-up soccer, cook mediterranean and pet any dog I meet. I keep visual journals where I collect design ideas, inspiration and make all sorts of lists. I love lists. One of my favorite experiences in life is to find myself in a new city and go exploring. I'm also fascinated by behavioral economicsâ€”how we make decisions and why we act the way we do. Ask me about it and I will talk your ear right off.</p>
    <p>I am a sponge for all things web development so if you have any advice or questions or are looking for a newbie coder who's weirdly enthusiastic about RESTful routes, closures and database queries, please <a href='mailto:chrisheuberg@gmail.com'>reach out!</a> I'd really love to hear from you.<p>
