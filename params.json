{"name":"Chris Heuberger","tagline":"web developer + designer","body":"A little about me: I am a full-stack web developer with a background in graphic designer.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in how information is organized and presented to convey a message or to create something amazing. I see development as an essential part of design; the function behind the form that allows us to guide how people interact with technology and each other.\r\n\r\nMy goal in all my work is to apply principles of behavioral economics—the art and science of how we make decisions—toward design for better interaction, participation and engagement.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisBup)  \r\n[LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/chrisheuberger/)\r\n\r\n[contact me!](mailto:christopherheuberger@gmail.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
