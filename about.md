      <p>I’m a full-stack web developer, though I focus more on the front end. I’m into social impact projects, data visualization, typography, and all forms of design as well as science, math, art, and pretty much every other subject. I like running, reading non-fiction, learning about quantum mechanics and relativity, deeply analyzing works of art, organizing everything, making lists, cooking mediterranean, and petting any dog I meet. I volunteer with the amazing organization <a href="https://www.dare2bnyc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Dare2B">Dare2B</a>. My last name is pronounced <strong><em>HIGH-ber-ger</em></strong> but I’m not a stickler.</p>
